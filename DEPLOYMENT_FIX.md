# Quick Fix for Vercel Deployment

Your UMA website is successfully on GitHub! The deployment is failing due to a TypeScript configuration issue. Here's the simple fix:

## Option 1: Deploy Frontend Only (Recommended)

Since your website is primarily a showcase site, deploy just the frontend:

1. **Create a new Vercel project** from your GitHub repository
2. **Set Framework Preset** to "Vite"
3. **Set Build Command** to: `vite build`
4. **Set Output Directory** to: `dist`
5. **Set Root Directory** to: `client`

## Option 2: Fix the TypeScript Issue

The error is in `server/vite.ts` line 26. The fix is:

```typescript
// Change this:
allowedHosts: true,

// To this:
allowedHosts: ["localhost", "127.0.0.1"],
```

## Option 3: Use Static Site Generation

Your UMA website can work perfectly as a static site. The contact form can be connected to:
- Netlify Forms
- Formspree
- EmailJS

## Current Status

✅ **Complete UMA website pushed to GitHub**
✅ **Professional accounting firm design**
✅ **All pages and sections working**
✅ **Responsive design**
✅ **Contact form ready**

❌ **Vercel deployment blocked by TypeScript error**

The website is fully functional - just needs the deployment configuration adjusted!
