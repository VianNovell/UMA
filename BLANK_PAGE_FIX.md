# Fix for Blank Page on Vercel Deployment

## Root Cause Identified
The blank page issue is caused by a Tailwind CSS configuration error in the build process. The error occurs during the CSS compilation phase.

## Issue Details
- Build fails with `border-border` CSS class error
- Tailwind content configuration missing for client build
- PostCSS configuration conflicts

## Quick Fix for Vercel Deployment

### Option 1: Update Vercel Project Settings
In your Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to Project Settings
2. Set **Framework Preset** to "Vite"
3. Set **Root Directory** to "client"
4. Set **Build Command** to: `npm install && npm run build`
5. Set **Output Directory** to: `dist`

### Option 2: Use Static Deployment
Since the TypeScript server issues are complex, deploy as static site:
1. In Vercel, change build settings to use only the client
2. For contact form, use Netlify Forms or Formspree instead of backend

### Option 3: Push Fixed Code
The files I created (client/tailwind.config.ts, client/postcss.config.js) will fix the build issues.
